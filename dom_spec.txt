# Here is where I will describe the DOM spec:
#	DOM4 working draft

# Resource:
# http://www.w3.org/TR/domcore/

# The DOM is a tree
#
#	each element in the tree:
#		has a parent - another object or null
#		has children - list of zero or more objects
#
# 	root - elem without parent
#
#	A is a descendant of B <=> (A is child of B) or (A is child of object C AND C is descendant of B)
#	
#	A is ancestor of B <=> B is descendant of A
#
#	A is sibling of B <=> (parent(A) == parent(B)) AND parent(A) != null
#
#	the DOM tree has a *tree order*
#		A can preceed or follow B in the tree order
#
#	first and last children are well-defined
#		children have ordering
#
#	previous and next sibling are well-defined
#		because siblings (children of their common parent) have ordering
#
#	index of A is its number of preceeding siblings
#		i.e. traditional array index
